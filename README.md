1. IBM ACE Toolkit Experience

    A.  Lab 1 -  Basic PING flow with Toolkit 
        This is a basic toolkit lab that you will create a simple Ping flow and then test locally and deploy to the ACE runtime. 

    B.  Lab 2 - Using JavaCompute Node to split up a large input file

2. IBM MQ

<br>A.  Lab 1 - Introduction to IBM MQ.
    <br>Objectives for Lab 1
	    <br>• Create Queue Managers.
	    <br>• Work with Queues (create, test, browse.delete)
	    <br>• Connect queue managers using channels, and explore distributed queuing
	    <br>• Create a Queue Manager Group (or Set)
	    <br>• Administer a Group of Queue Managers Collectively
	    <br>• Use Filters
<br>
<br>B.  Lab 2 - Configuring the IBM MQ JMS Provider
    <br><br>The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate some of the typical steps you will go through when configuring IBM MQ as a JMS provider. Some of the tasks that you will perform include:
	<br><br>    • Configure the Administered objects that a JMS program typically requires. Administered objects are used to externalize Connection Factories and Destinations from the program. This allows JMS Applications to be portable between Messaging Providers by shielding the applications from provider-specific details.
	    <br>• Define a Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) directory. In this lab you will perform the following:
     <br>
		<br>      ○ Create a JNDI directory
		    <br>  ○ Populate it with Connection Factory and Destination definitions
		      <br>○ Use the MQ Explorer wizard to create corresponding MQ definitions
		      <br>○ Run one of the Java™ Message Service (JMS) sample programs from the command line to use those definitions to connect to MQ as a JMS provider and produce JMS messages
<br>

<br>3. IBM Datapower
A.  LAB 1. Content Transformation
    <br>In this lab, you will create a fully functional Multi-Protocol gateway service that will transform message from REST (JSON) to SOAP (XML) and from SOAP (XML) to REST (JSON).
    <br>Upon completing this lab, you will have a better understanding of:
	<br>    • How messages are processed
	   <br> • The Multi-Protocol Gateway service configuration
	    <br>• Front-side protocol handlers
	    <br>• Configuring Processing Policies, Rules, and Actions
 <br>     	• Developing on XSLT to transform the content of the messages
